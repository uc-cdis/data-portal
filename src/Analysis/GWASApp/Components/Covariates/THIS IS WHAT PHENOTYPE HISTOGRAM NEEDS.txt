THIS IS WHAT PHENOTYPE HISTOGRAM NEEDS

<PhenotypeHistogram
  dispatch="{dispatch}"
  selectedStudyPopulationCohort="{selectedStudyPopulationCohort}"
  selectedCovariates="{selectedCovariates}"
  outcome="{outcome}"
  selectedContinuousItem="{selected}"
/>

LINE 67
data-portal/src/Analysis/GWASApp/Components/Covariates/ContinuousCovariates.jsx


These values are props from data-portal/src/Analysis/GWASApp/Steps/SelectOutcome/SelectOutcome.jsx
and available as part of reducer state dispatched obj:

selectedStudyPopulationCohort => YES
selectedCovariates => probably? Covariates
outcome => YES
selectedContinuousItem => hopefully from table row data somewhere?
