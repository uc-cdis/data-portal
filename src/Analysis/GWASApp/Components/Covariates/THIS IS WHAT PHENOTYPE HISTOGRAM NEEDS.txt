THIS IS WHAT PHENOTYPE HISTOGRAM NEEDS

<PhenotypeHistogram
  dispatch="{dispatch}"
  selectedStudyPopulationCohort="{selectedStudyPopulationCohort}"
  selectedCovariates="{selectedCovariates}"
  outcome="{outcome}"
  selectedContinuousItem="{selected}"
/>

LINE 67
data-portal/src/Analysis/GWASApp/Components/Covariates/ContinuousCovariates.jsx


These values are props from data-portal/src/Analysis/GWASApp/Steps/SelectOutcome/SelectOutcome.jsx
and available as part of reducer state dispatched obj:

selectedStudyPopulationCohort => YES
selectedCovariates => probably? Covariates
outcome => YES
selectedContinuousItem => hopefully from table row data somewhere?


selectedContinuousItem is this type of object:
Object {
  concept_id: 2000006886,
  prefixed_concept_id: "ID_2000006886",
  concept_name: "Attribute1",
  concept_code: "",
  concept_type: "MVP Continuous"
}

FOR ATTRITION TABLE ROW:

  dispatch: PropTypes.func.isRequired,  -> NEED DISPATCH
  selectedStudyPopulationCohort: selectedCohort -> GOOD
  selectedCovariates: PropTypes.array ????? -> NEED COVARIATES
  outcome: outcome -> GOOD
  selectedContinuousItem: rowObject -> GOOD
